## ðŸ’» Getting started

To install FastPathology, follow the instructions for your operating system:

<details open>
<summary>

### Windows (10 or newer)</summary>
* Download and run the Windows installer from the [release page](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology/releases/). 
  *Note: Windows might prompt you with a security warning, to proceed you must press "More info" followed by "Run anyway".*
* Run **fastpathology** from your start menu.
* To **uninstall** the application, go to start menu -> remove programs -> find fastpathology and select uninstall.
  Optionally you can also delete your `C:/Users/"your username"/fastpathology/` which includes stored project results, pipelines, and models.
  And the folder `C:/ProgramData/FAST/` which contains a cache.
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>

### Ubuntu Linux (18.04 or newer)</summary>

- Install OpenCL for Linux by downloading an implementation depending on the CPU/GPU you have:
   - **NVIDIA** - Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
   - **Intel** - Install the [OpenCL NEO driver](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases).
   - **AMD** - Install the [ROCm stack](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html).
   - If none of the above fits, you can try the [Portable Computing Lanauge (PCOL)](http://portablecl.org), although reduced performance is likely.
* Download the debian package from the [release page](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology/releases/).
* Install the debian package from the terminal or by double-clicking it:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i fastpathology_ubuntu*.deb
```
* Go to the folder `/opt/fastpathology/bin/` and run the **fastpathology** executable, or run it from the ubuntu menu (`windows button->type fastpathology`).
* To **uninstall** the application, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
sudo apt remove fastpathology
# Optionally, you can also delete your fastpathology folder 
# which includes stored project results, pipelines and models.
# and the FAST folder which stores cache files.
rm -Rf $HOME/fastpathology
rm -Rf $HOME/FAST
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>

### macOS (10.13 or newer)</summary>

*Note that the macOS version of FastPathology is experimental.*

* Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it. Then, install the following packages using homebrew:
```bash
brew install openslide libomp
```
* Download and run the macOS installer (.dmg) from the [release page](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology/releases/). Download the x86_64 file if you have an Intel CPU, or download the arm64 file if you have an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) CPU.
* In the installer, drag-and-drop the `FastPathology` bundle to the `Applications` directory.
* When the copy is finished, double-click the `Applications` icon in the installer and right-click + open `FastPathology` from the Applications menu.
* A warning should be prompted `"macOS cannot verify the developer of FastPathology (...)"`, click `open` and the program should launch.

 *Note: This is only required to be done once. For all future usage, launch FastPathology as a regular App bundle.*
* To **uninstall** the application, delete the extracted folder.
  Optionally, you can also delete the `/Users/"your username"/fastpathology/` folder, which includes stored project results, pipelines, and models.
  And the folder `/Users/"your username"/FAST/` which contains a cache.

### Optional: NVIDIA GPU Inference</summary>

If you have an NVIDIA GPU on your machine you can enable high-speed inference by downloading and installing the following:
* [CUDA 11](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
* [cuDNN 8.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
* [TensorRT 8.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-download)

**Note: Make sure to download the correct versions. NVIDIA GPU inference is not supported on Mac.**

## License

The source code of FastPathology is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license, however the FastPathology program use and are linked with many great third-party libraries which have several different open source licenses, see the licenses folder in the installation folder for more details.

## ðŸ“¹ Demos and tutorials

Very simple demonstrations of the platform can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GM2KW54-vEZ0M1kH5-oig). More in-depth demonstrations will be added in the future. Wikis and tutorials can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/SINTEFMedtek/FAST-Pathology/wiki). More information can be found from the **pages** section on the right in the wiki home.

## ðŸŽŠ Features

The software is implemented in C++ based using [FAST](https://github.com/smistad/FAST). A wide range of features have been added to make working with whole slide images (WSIs) a piece of cake!
* **Graphical User Interface -** User-friendly GUI for working with WSIs without any code interaction.
* **Deep learning -** Deployment and support for multi-input/output convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
* **Visualization -** Real-time streaming of predictions on top of the WSI with low memory cost.
* **Use cases -** Patch-wise classification, low and high-resolution segmentation, and object detection are supported.
* **Inference Engines -** FAST includes a variety of different inference engines, i.e. TensorFlow CPU/CUDA (support both TF v1 and v2 models), TensorRT (UFF and ONNX), OpenVINO (CPU/GPU/VPU), and ONNX Runtime (CPU/GPU).
* **Text pipelines -** Possibility to create your own pipelines using the built-in script editor.
* **Formats -** Through [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/) FastPathology supports various WSI formats.

## ðŸ”¨ Development setup</summary>

1. Either
   - [Download and install a release of FAST](https://fast.eriksmistad.no/install.html).
   - [Compile and install FAST on your system](https://fast.eriksmistad.no/building-fast.html).
2. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology.git
   ```
3. Setup build environment using CMake  
   *Linux (Ubuntu)*
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DFAST_DIR=/path/to/FAST/cmake/
   ``` 
   *Windows (Visual Studio)*
   Modify generator -G string to match your Visual studio version. This command will create a visual studio solution in your build folder.
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DFAST_DIR=C:\path\to\FAST\cmake\ -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
   ```
4. Build
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --config Release --target fastpathology
   ```
5. Run
   *Linux (Ubuntu)*
   ```bash
   ./fastpathology
   ```
   *Windows*
   ```powershell
   cd Release
   fastpathology.exe
   ```

**NOTE:** Visual Studio 19 has been tested with both FAST and FastPathology and works well.
