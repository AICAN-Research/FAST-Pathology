# Contributing to FAST-Pathology
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Asking questions
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Questions and discussion
Please use our [Discussions forum on GitHub](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology/discussions) for asking questions or discussing FAST-Pathology.
There are no stupid questions, so don't hesitate to ask.
We also love to see how you use FAST-Pathology in your projects, so please show and tell us.
Please also see our [code of conduct](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting code
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
Note that most of FAST-Pathology's functionality actually comes from the [FAST](https://github.com/smistad/FAST) framework, 
FAST-Pathology is essentially a graphical user interface built on top of FAST. 
Thus if you want to propose changes which are not part of the FAST-Pathology user interface, you should take a look at contributing to [FAST](https://github.com/smistad/FAST) instead.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Modify the code in your branch
3. Make sure the software runs and works
4. Submit the pull request

If you are unsure how to do this properly, just ask us at the [Discussions forum on GitHub](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology/discussions).

When you submit code changes, your submissions will be under the [BSD-2 clause license](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that covers the project.
